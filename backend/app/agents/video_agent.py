Video Generator Agent - Creates educational videos from clinical trial information

This agent should:
1. Take structured trial data and patient-friendly text
2. Generate video script with narration
3. Create animations/visual scenes
4. Synthesize voiceover (Text-to-Speech)
5. Combine into final video

    TODO: ADD AGENT LOGIC HERE
    
    Implementation approaches:
    
    1. Use AI Video Generation Services:
       a) D-ID API (realistic AI avatars):
          ```python
          import requests
          
          response = requests.post(
              "https://api.d-id.com/talks",
              headers={"authorization": f"Basic {api_key}"},
              json={
                  "script": {"type": "text", "input": narration_text},
                  "source_url": avatar_image_url
              }
          )
          ```
       
       b) Synthesia API (AI video platform):
          - Upload script
          - Choose avatar and voice
          - Generate video
       
       c) HeyGen API
       
    2. Use MoviePy for programmatic video creation:
       ```python
       from moviepy.editor import *
       
       # Create text clips
       txt_clip = TextClip("Study Timeline", fontsize=70, color='white')
       
       # Create animations
       clips = [txt_clip, image_clip, ...]
       
       # Combine and export
       final = concatenate_videoclips(clips)
       final.write_videofile(output_path)
       ```
    
    3. Use Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine):
       ```python
       from manim import *
       
       class TrialExplanation(Scene):
           def construct(self):
               # Create animated scenes
               text = Text("Clinical Trial Overview")
               self.play(Write(text))
       ```
    
    4. Combine multiple tools:
       - Script generation: GPT-4
       - TTS: Google Cloud TTS, Amazon Polly, ElevenLabs
       - Visuals: Stable Diffusion, DALL-E
       - Assembly: FFmpeg, MoviePy
       
       Example pipeline:
       ```python
       # 1. Generate script
       script = generate_script_with_gpt(trial_data)
       
       # 2. Create voiceover
       audio = text_to_speech(script)
       
       # 3. Generate scene images
       scenes = [generate_image(prompt) for prompt in scene_prompts]
       
       # 4. Combine with MoviePy
       video_clips = [ImageClip(scene).set_duration(5) for scene in scenes]
       final = concatenate_videoclips(video_clips)
       final.audio = audio
       final.write_videofile(output_path)
       ```
    
    5. Use Remotion (React for video):
       - Generate video programmatically with React components
       - Render server-side
