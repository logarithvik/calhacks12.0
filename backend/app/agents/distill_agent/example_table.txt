Video Outline Example: Cemiplimab Clinical Trial (Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Category: Significance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content:
Significance: 2nd most common malignancy in US, hundreds of thousands of people impacted.
Numbers doubled from 1994–2006.

Duration of Video: 5–10 sec
Agent Functions:
- Generate graph and statistics visualization.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Category: Purpose of the Study
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content:
The study tests cemiplimab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that targets the PD-1 immune checkpoint.
Can further explain what is PD-1 immune checkpoint — possibly using an analogy.
It is being evaluated for people with advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC),
either metastatic (spread to lymph nodes or distant organs) or cannot be removed with surgery or treated with radiation.

Duration of Video: 10–15 sec
Agent Functions:
- Generate narrated explanation with visuals of PD-1 mechanism.
- Create generative video/images illustrating the biological process.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Category: Who Can Participate
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content:
Participants must:
- Be 18 or older with confirmed invasive CSCC.
- Meet other eligibility criteria such as overall health and CSCC condition.

Duration of Video: 5 sec
Agent Functions:
- Display brief diagram or infographic summarizing eligibility criteria.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Category: What Participation Involves
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content:
Screening Period: Up to 4 weeks, including blood tests, imaging (CT/MRI), ECG, and biopsies.

Treatment Period:
- Cemiplimab given intravenously (IV) every 2–4 weeks for 48–108 weeks.
- Some participants may later switch to subcutaneous (SC) injections after 27 weeks if disease remains stable.
- Participation could last up to 2 years including follow-up.

Follow-Up: 6 months to 1.5 years post-treatment to monitor safety and effects.

A typical visit includes physical exams, lab tests, imaging, questionnaires, or biopsies.

If duration is given in weeks and greater than 10, express it in months.

Duration of Video: 15 sec (after trimming)
Agent Functions:
- Create study flowchart or animated diagram summarizing timeline and stages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Category: Possible Benefits
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content:
- Cemiplimab may help your immune system fight cancer.
- Prior studies showed tumor shrinkage or control in some people with advanced CSCC.
- You’ll receive close medical monitoring throughout the study.

Duration of Video: 10 sec
Agent Functions:
- Generate reassuring narrative with supportive visuals of immune response and clinical care.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Category: Possible Side Effects
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Content:
Cemiplimab works by stimulating the immune system, which can sometimes attack normal organs.

Possible side effects include:
Fatigue, rash, itching, diarrhea, fever, chills, shortness of breath,
inflammation of organs (liver, lungs, colon, thyroid, kidneys, endocrine glands),
colitis, thyroid disorders, skin reactions, neurologic events.

If side effects are unbearable, participants may stop the drug or request alternate medications at no cost.

Duration of Video: 15 sec
Agent Functions:
- Display side effect list visually (text on screen).
- Continue showing molecular mechanism visuals simplified for patient understanding.
- Prompt study administrator for input on phrasing sensitive content.
