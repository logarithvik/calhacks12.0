### 4. Test Infographic Generation

1. After summary is generated, click "Generate" under Infographic
2. Wait for processing

**Expected Result**:
- Infographic card shows "Generated"
- Infographic section appears with placeholder
- Shows file path (e.g., `uploads/infographic_1.png`)

### 5. Test Video Generation

1. After summary is generated, click "Generate" under Video
2. Wait for processing

**Expected Result**:
- Video card shows "Generated"
- Video section appears with placeholder
- Shows mock video script in content details

### 6. Test Regeneration

1. Click "Regenerate" on any generated content
2. Should update version number

**Expected Result**: Content updates, version increments

### 7. Test Navigation

1. Click "Back to Dashboard"
2. Should see the trial in the list
3. Trial should show generated content badges (summary, infographic, video)

### 8. Test Trial Deletion

1. On dashboard, click trash icon on a trial
2. Confirm deletion
3. Trial disappears from list

**Expected Result**: Trial removed from database

## API Testing with curl

### Register User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "apitest",
    "email": "api@test.com",
    "password": "test123"
  }'
```

### Login

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login \
  -F "username=apitest" \
  -F "password=test123"
```

Save the returned token:
```bash
TOKEN="<your-token-here>"
```

### Upload Trial

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/trials/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "title=API Test Trial" \
  -F "protocol_file=@sample_protocol.txt"
```

### Generate Summary

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate/summary/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### Get Trial Details

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/trials/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

## Testing with Interactive API Docs

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. You'll see Swagger UI with all endpoints
3. Click "Authorize" button
4. Login to get token
5. Use the token to test other endpoints

## Common Issues

### 1. "Trial not found" Error
- **Cause**: Trial ID doesn't exist or belongs to different user
- **Fix**: Check trial ID, verify you're logged in as correct user

### 2. "Please generate summary first"
- **Cause**: Trying to generate infographic/video without summary
- **Fix**: Generate summary first (it's required)

### 3. Database Connection Error
- **Cause**: PostgreSQL not running or wrong credentials
- **Fix**: 
  ```bash
  # Check PostgreSQL is running
  pg_isready
  
  # Start PostgreSQL (macOS)
  brew services start postgresql
  ```

### 4. File Upload Fails
- **Cause**: File too large or wrong format
- **Fix**: Use PDF or TXT files under 10MB

### 5. Frontend Can't Connect to Backend
- **Cause**: Backend not running or wrong API URL
- **Fix**: 
  - Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`
  - Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend/.env

## Performance Testing

### Test with Multiple Trials

```bash
# Upload 5 trials
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/trials/ \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    -F "title=Test Trial $i" \
    -F "protocol_file=@sample_protocol.txt"
done
```

### Test Concurrent Generation

```bash
# Generate summaries for multiple trials simultaneously
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate/summary/1 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" &
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate/summary/2 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" &
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/generate/summary/3 -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" &
wait
```

## Next Steps: Adding Real AI

Once testing is complete, implement real AI logic:

1. **Add API Keys**:
   ```bash
   echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> backend/.env
   ```

2. **Install AI Libraries**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install openai anthropic langchain
   ```

3. **Implement Agents**:
   - Edit `backend/app/agents/distill_agent.py`
   - Edit `backend/app/agents/infographic_agent.py`
   - Edit `backend/app/agents/video_agent.py`

4. **Test with Real Protocol**:
   - Download a real clinical trial protocol PDF
   - Upload and generate
   - Verify extraction quality

## Debugging Tips

### Check Backend Logs
```bash
# Backend should print requests
# Look for errors or stack traces
```

### Check Browser Console
```bash
# Open browser DevTools (F12)
# Check Console tab for errors
# Check Network tab for failed requests
```

### Check Database
```bash
psql trial_edu_db

# List users
SELECT * FROM users;

# List trials
SELECT * FROM trials;

# List generated content
SELECT * FROM generated_content;
```

### Reset Database
```bash
# Drop and recreate
dropdb trial_edu_db
createdb trial_edu_db

# Restart backend to recreate tables
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… Can register and login  
âœ… Can upload trial protocol  
âœ… Can generate summary with mock data  
âœ… Can generate infographic (placeholder)  
âœ… Can generate video (placeholder)  
âœ… Can view all generated content  
âœ… Can delete trials  
âœ… Data persists across page refreshes

**Ready for the hackathon!** ðŸŽ‰

When you implement real AI logic, repeat these tests to verify everything still works.
